# Cephas Teom - Synths
A synth library built on Tone.js. Standardised methods for triggering events and mutating parameters. Originally designed for use with [Zen](https://zen.cephasteom.co.uk/) but can be used in other web audio projects.

`Set` methods configure parameters prior to using `.play()`. Methods prefixed with an `_` mutate parameters as the synth is running (in line with the Zen language syntax for mutable synth parameters).
